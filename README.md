This repository contains a collection of popular robot models with associated urdf models and meshes.
The joint control is achieved through [gazeboyarpplugins](https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/)
motor control boards. The models can be launched in gazebo and controlled through [yarp](https://www.yarp.it/) infrastructure as the
robotic middleware.
